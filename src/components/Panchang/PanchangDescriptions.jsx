            Panchang : What Are Its Elements?
          </h1>
          <p>
            The Sanskrit word Panchangam, also known as Panchang, is made up of
            two words: panch, which means five, and ang, which means parts.
            Panchang is created by taking into account five aspects or elements
            of traditional Hindu timekeeping: Tithi, Nakshatra, Yog, Vaar, and
            Karana. Let’s understand each of these elements in more detail.
          </p>
          <p className="font-bold text-lg">Tithi</p>
          <p>
            According to the Hindu Panchang, there are approximately
            30 Tithi (Lunar Days) per month. The first fifteen days are called
            Shukla Paksha, and the later fifteen days are known as Krishna
            Paksha. These are the two phases of the Moon's waxing and waning
            periods, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Hindu calendar, Purnima Tithi (full Moon) and Amavasya Tithi
            (no Moon) happen once a month. Purnima is considered the 15th Tithi,
            Amavasya is considered the 30th Tithi, and other Tithis occur twice
            a month. These include Pratipada, Dwitiya, Tritiya, Chaturthi,
            Panchami, Shashti, Saptami, Ashtami, Navami, Dashami, Ekadashi,
            Dwadashi, Trayodashi, and Chaturdashi.{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="font-bold text-lg">Nakshatra</p>
          <p>
            A Nakshatra, derived from the Sanskrit word “Naksha” meaning map and
            “Tara” meaning star, determines the position of the stars at a given
            time of the day based on the Moon’s position in the birth chart. In
            Indian Vedic astrology, there are 27 Nakshatras. In Muhurtha
            astrology, there is also a 28th Nakshatra known as the Abhijeet
            Nakshatra. Every Nakshatra is thought to be advantageous or
            appropriate for a specific task in Hinduism. These include getting
            married, Griha Pravesh, housewarming, the Namkaran ceremony,
            purchasing a new car or house, starting a new job or business, and
            so on.{" "}
          </p>
          <p className="font-bold text-lg">Yog</p>
          <p>
            A Yog is formed by the combination of the Sun and the Moon. In Vedic
            astrology, there are 27 Yogs or Yogas. These Yogs can be both
            auspicious and inauspicious. Each Yog is useful for one day in a
            person's life.
          </p>
          <p className="font-bold text-lg">Karan</p>
          <p>
            A half-Tithi is referred to as a Karana, meaning two Karanas equal
            one Tithi. There are 11 Karans in total in astrology. Seven Karans
            are movable, and four are stationary. Eight of these Karans fall
            within a lunar month. There are two Karans called the Purvardha and
            Uttarardha Karan every day.
          </p>
          <p className="font-bold text-lg">Vaar</p>
          <p>
            Vaar refers to the time between one sunrise and the next sunrise.
            There are seven Vaars, namely Ravivaar (Sunday), Somvaar (Monday),
            Mangalvaar (Tuesday), Budhvaar (Wednesday), Brihaspativaar
            (Thursday), Shukravaar (Friday), and Shanivaar (Saturday).

            What’s the importance of Panchang?
            <br /> Why is it Necessary?
          </h1>
          <p>
            In Hinduism, auspicious work is not performed without first
            consulting the Panchang. The Indian Hindu calendar holds significant
            value in Vedic astrology and has been used in India for thousands of
            years. Hindus consult Panchang for any auspicious occasion or
            function, as it provides detailed knowledge and significance of a
            specific date and time period.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is believed that if one is going to embark on a new journey or
            task, be it a business, career, marriage, etc., one should do so at
            the right time, which can be found by checking the Panchang.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Hindu calendar is based on the positions of celestial bodies.
            Hindu Panchang offers valuable information to astrologers and anyone
            interested in astrology by calculating significant astrological
            data. Astrologers use a Panchangam to determine auspicious times and
            other crucial astrological details for different social and
            religious events. In a traditional Hindu society, panchang is
            important in determining the appropriate day and time for performing
            rituals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without a Panchang, we are unable to determine an auspicious day and
            time. The Vaar, Karan, Yog, Nakshatra, and Tithi are used to
            determine whether a Muhurta is good or bad.{" "}

            How Is Panchang Beneficial?
          </h1>
          <p>
            The study of Panchang is the fundamental understanding of Rashi
            Phala, the impact of each of the 12 zodiac signs on an individual,
            and how their day-to-day lives change based on several movements of
            the planets. The casting of a Panchang requires detailed
            mathematical work involving a high level of spherical geometry and
            an in-depth understanding of the movements of the planets and the
            stars.
          </p>
          <p className="space-y-4">
            <li>
            Panchang is created for the fundamental purpose of providing information on how a day might look, how people should optimize the ‘Shubh’ or positive span of time in order to lead a happy and prosperous life, and what they should refrain from doing at negative hours of the day to avoid problems. 
            </li>
            <li>
            Panchang is optimally utilized in Hindu culture for planning important events and functions in a person’s life. Panchang matches the current planetary configurations with the position of the heavenly bodies in a person’s astrological chart so that auspicious days and times can be pin-pointed in their best interests.
            </li>
            <li>
            The Panchang is also used to calculate a person's Vedic birth chart or natal chart. The calculations done to create a Panchang are based upon the position or movement of planets, stars, or Nakshatra in a certain sign at certain degrees. These calculations represent how these movements and transitions are supposed to affect a person on a particular date and can be done to minimize the negative effects and maximize the positive effects.
            </li>
            <li>
            With the help of Panchang, you can accurately plan your job interviews, travel plans, investments, festivals, pujas, and the beginning of any significant tasks.
