          Tarot card reading is a traditional divination method that uses the
          cards to reveal insights and predict future events. All of this is
          based on the interpretation of tarot cards. The meanings of the cards
          that we know today are credited to Cartomancer Jean-Baptiste Alliette
          (also known as Etteilla) and Marie Anne Adelaide Lenormand
          (1776-1843).

          A traditional tarot deck comprises seventy-eight cards. The deck is
          further divided into two groups.

        <p>
          <span className="text-black font-bold">Major Arcana</span> - The Major
          Arcana consists of 22 cards, each with its own interpretation that can
          only be determined by someone who understands the cards. Tarot cards
          can be used to uncover secrets about upcoming events and to plan for
          the future. Each Major Arcana card depicts a scene with one or more
          people and various elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="text-black font-bold">Major Arcana</span> - On the
          other hand, the Minor Arcana, also called the Lesser Arcana, comprises
          56 suit cards. These cards, too, form an integral part of any tarot
          reading. There are four suits, with 14 cards in each suit. The suits
          include four categories, as follows.

          How Does Tarot Card Reading Work?
        </h1>
        <p>
          A tarot card is essentially a combination of symbolism, intuition, and
          the ability to construct a narrative from the cards selected or chosen
          during a reading. It is a tool for self-discovery, reflection, and
          gaining new perspectives on life's journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tarot card reading is like navigating a captivating tapestry of life
          woven with Major and Minor Arcana cards. When the cards are pulled, it
          is as if conducting a dance, manifesting the signs of the cards and
          the feelings of the seeker in unison.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the divine cards speak through their symbolic meanings and as
          they unfold, they form a narrative that feels true to the questions
          resonating with your thoughts. Remember, the ability to decipher these
          secrets does not lie simply within the cards; it lies in your personal
          story and the reader’s intuitive interpretation and insights.
