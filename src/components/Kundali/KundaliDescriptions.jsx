            What is a Kundali or Janma Kundli?
          </h1>
          <p>
            A Kundli or Janmapatri is the details about an individual. This
            unique Kundali chart in Astrology consists of elements regarding the
            placement of heavenly bodies, that is, the planets or Navagrahas and
            constellations or Nakshatras. An accurate Kundali is made after
            considering these elements, and accordingly, insights are produced.
            These Janam Kundali predictions or insights are based on various
            aspects of the new born baby Kundali, including the Houses, the
            placement of Nakshatras, the influence of planets, and the
            associated Rashis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each element has its distinct role, and varied combinations of
            planets affect individuals differently. Astrologers create astrology
            Kundli by thoroughly reading the crucial aspects of a person's birth
            details, such as their date, time and place of birth, along with the
            position of planets and Nakshatras when they are born. For example,
            favourable combinations of planets in your Janm Kundali will result
            in promising results. Unfavourable conjunctions of planets will
            result in inauspicious results. However, in modern times, there are
            also free Kundli software that can help you get your Kundli in a
            fraction of a second.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although a Janam Kundali by date of birth, made by an astrologer, is
            often the first choice of people, an online Kundli is no different
            compared to it. Head over to InstaAstro’s website, contact any of
            our professional astrologers and get your Janam Kundali by date of
            birth and time. In addition, you can also get in touch with our
